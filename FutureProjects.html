	<h1>A bit about Future projects!</h1>
		<p>At the moment, this page will only be text, simply because I don't have much to show for my future projects, and what I do have I personally don't think is worth showing at the moment.</p>
		<h3>GIMM unity game project-</h3>
		<p>This is still VERY early in development, but I currently have a Unity engine based game in the works for GIMM. Currently, it is going to be a puzzle game, where you play as a little dragon going through a castle/dungeon. You solve puzzles in each room to continue to the next, until finally, you leave the place. I don't plan on having it be a VR game, but who knows, plans change!</p>
		<p>It's also very possible that I decide not to go with this game idea, and come up with something new entirely! But right now, this is the current plan.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Projects-</h3>
		<p>I have a few projects in mind, not for the GIMM program. As I'm doing these in my own free time, they will take longer than my projects from GIMM, but I plan on putting all my effort into these projects as well to make something cool!</p>
		<p>I mentioned before that I draw in my spare time, and I'd love to make a webcomic! I have actually completed a small comic project in the past for a high school project, but at the time my digital art skills were still pretty shaky, and I have vastly improved since then. I wanted to make a comic with a story focus. While I have a few storylines in mind, when I find the proper time and inspiration for the project is when it will go under production.</p>
		<p>Somewhat related to the above project, I want to also make a visual novel! Visual novels are pretty much what they sound like, but I would be handling pretty much everything behind the project, ncluding the art, sound, writing, and coding. Similar to the webcomic idea, I have a few storylines I'm considering, but when I actually sit down to begin developing the project will things become more concrete. The main thing that I have in mind now, is that I know for sure I want it to be a horror genre visual novel, since threre are only a few good ones out there.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I wanted to dabble in music production. I recently started working with the UTAU synth program, which is a free program used to edit vocal synthesizers to sing whatever lyrics you input. While right know, I'm only using the program to make covers of other songs, around the summer of this year I plan on starting to work on original songs and music. Some being instrumental, others utilizing the voice synths from the UTAU program. (I even have plans to create a voice synth for my own voice to use in songs, but that's also a ways off). </p>
		
		<h3>This may seem like a lot of stuff planned...</h3>
		<p>...and it is! While I'm fully aware of the time and effort required to go into any one of these projects, I'm determined to see some of these projects come to light, even if it takes quite a long time before they do.</p>
