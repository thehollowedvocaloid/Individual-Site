		<h1>A bit about this game!</h1>
		<p>This game was made in Adobe Animate, a later version of Flash. We were provided with some base code to work with, then build our own game off of that. The base code I used was a basic game where a bow would shoot arrows at balloons, but that was it.</p>
		<p>I decided I wanted to make an alien shooter, and went from there. I coded the movement, the scoring, and the damage collision detection. I also drew all the art for it. While all very simple, I'm still a little proud of this small flash game, considering I had never made any sort of game prior to it.</p>

	<h1> A bit about this project!</h1>
		<p>For the first year of GIMM, we were all tasked with animating our own music videos. My idea was a little bit too ambitious, so I ended only making a basic animatic for the project, but I put many hours into drawing the frames for all different shots.</p>
		<p>While still somewhat basic, this project was a good learning experience, and I one day want to complete a similar animation project, using my planning and skills that I learned during this one towards that. I would love to seriously get into animating one day, and I think this project gave me a good idea on what kind of workload it requires.</p>

		<h1>Some projects not shown</h1>
		<p>There were a few other projects I have done personally and over the course of GIMM, which I have not listed here, but I would still like to mention. (Who knows, I might update this page later).</p>
		<p>First, there was a group game created in the second semester in GIMM, also in Adobe Animate. It was a very simple dungeon crawler, and it even had a dragon boss fight at the end! I'm still a little impressed at what the team was able to accomplish.</p>
		<p>A Bit more recently, we had a VR project last semester, which involved shooting a 3D video. In this video, me and my teammates dressed as 'Paranormal Investigators', and searched a garage looking for haunted things. Our third teammate, dressed as a ghost, slowly came up behind us and scaring us, ending the video. We did this because the video shot required the viewer to move around (they would be viewing it in a VR headset) to see all the things happening in the video.</p>
		<p>While all these early projeccts seem a little basic, they have provided good experience and skills useful to continue forward with more complex projects.</p>
